# Crate & Barrel Box Calculator


The Crate and Barrel Box Calculator is an unoffical tool I created for stockware associates at Crate & Barrel to quickly and easily find the most suitable and efficient box for packaging merchandise. Finding, not only a box that fits a collection of items, but also one that leaves the least amount of remaining space. It has been used daily at my workplace and also serves as the first time my knowledge in coding has helped myself and others in my professional career, however small.


## How to Use

This program is made using simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Download those files and run the HTML page, or alternatively, you can simply visit my CodePen page for this project and use it there.

###### Triple Input
To use this program, measure out the **height**, **width**, and **length** in inches of your items and input the measurement into their respective boxes. The actual order of height, width, and length doesn't matter. Enter any space for padding, if necessary, and hit "Find me the best Box". The most efficient box number will appear below and the table below that will also adjust to show other alternative box numbers that could fit the entered measurements.

###### Single Input
To streamline the process a bit further because time is money, I also created a single input method. Enter a **6**-digit number that represents the length, width, and height of your items. For example: 150812 for an order being 15 inches tall, 8 inches wide, and 12 inches long. The program will automatically give you your the answer on the 6th digit. The numpad "." key can also be pressed to reset the program for another use.

###### Errors

An error display most often means the numbers entered are to large for an given box size. There could possibly be an inch of wiggle room with the boxes, but I wouldn't push it. It is also possible to rearrange multiple item orders in a different way so they could potentially fit in a box.
